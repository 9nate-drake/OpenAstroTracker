# The OpenAstroTracker:
A 3D printed, cheap Tracker for DSLR astrophotography.

## What parts to print:
**For latitude specific parts:**
All parts needed once, except:
 - part 10, needed 4 times

**For all latitudes:**
All parts needed once, except:
 -  part 17, twice
 - part 23, twice


The different versions for latitudes work in a +/- 5° degree range. Currently no support for southern hemisphere or latitudes outside 55-15° N.
