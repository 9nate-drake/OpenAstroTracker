The first release candidate of the OAT ASCOM Driver, to see how it performs on a new machine.

*	Known Issues
	*	The thing works intermittently at best on SGP, crashing when a target is set...for most people..but not everyone.
	*	There have been some reports of the TraceLogger trying to write to the application directory, which seems impossible.
